# K-R
Code for all the example programs from the famous C programming textbook [The C 
Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) (also known as K&R).
Most codes are exactly the same as those in the book while others are slightly modified based on modern version of C.
